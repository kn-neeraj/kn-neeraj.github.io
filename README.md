# Resouces for Learning Product Management.

I created this site to help people who are transitioning to Product Management roles and get bogged down by tonnes of resources thrown at them. In this website I have added top resources articles, books and videos (to the best of my knowledge) which are categorised by skills expected from a Product Manager. It also contains PM job interview resources.

Hope it helps aspiring PMs (including me!)
